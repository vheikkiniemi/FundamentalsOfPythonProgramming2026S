# 🐍 Task C - Handling Reservation Data

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this task is to practice:

*   type conversions in Python using a separate function
*   working with lists and structuring reservation data
*   printing reservation data using loops and conditional statements

***

## 📄 Description

You are given:

*   a text file **`reservations.txt`**, where each line contains the details of one reservation.
*   a Python script **`read_reservations.py`**, which includes pre-built functionality for reading reservations (including the function `convert_reservation_data`).

> [!NOTE]
> **You are not allowed to alter the reservations.txt file in this task!**

**Example line from `reservations.txt`:**

    201|Moomin Valley|moomin@whitevalley.org|0509876543|2025-11-12|09:00|2|18.50|True|Forest Area 1|2025-08-12 14:33:20

The line contains the following fields:

| Column                | Description           | Target Data Type    |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1  `reservationId`    | Reservation number    | `int`               |
| 2  `name`             | Name of reserver      | `str`               |
| 3  `email`            | Email address         | `str`               |
| 4  `phone`            | Phone number          | `str`               |
| 5  `reservationDate`  | Reservation date      | `datetime.date`     |
| 6  `reservationTime`  | Start time            | `datetime.time`     |
| 7  `durationHours`    | Duration in hours     | `int`               |
| 8  `price`            | Hourly price (€)      | `float`             |
| 9  `confirmed`        | Confirmed             | `bool`              |
| 10 `reservedResource` | Reserved resource     | `str`               |
| 11 `createdAt`        | When reservation made | `datetime.datetime` |

## 🧠 PART A: Fix `convert_reservation_data`

In this part, focus on converting a single reservation line into the correct data types.

> [!TIP]  
> Unlike previous tasks, here the function performs the conversion immediately after reading, and the program continues with the converted data.

***

### 1️⃣ Preparation

1.  Copy the file **`reservations.txt`** into your own Git repository under the folder `TaskC`.
2.  Copy the Python script **`read_reservations.py`** into the same `TaskC` folder.
3.  Rename the Python script file to **`task_c.py`**
4.  Make sure the program runs with the command → The program prints each reservation and the data types on their own separate lines (the reservation number is converted and complies with the task requirements):

    ```bash
    python task_c.py
    ```

***

### 2️⃣ The `convert_reservation_data` Function

The script contains a function called **`convert_reservation_data`**, which receives as a parameter **a list split from one line**. Example:

```python
["201", "Moomin Valley", "moomin@whitevalley.org", "0509876543", "2025-11-12", "09:00:00", "2", "18.50", "True", "Forest Area 1", "2025-08-12 14:33:20"]
```

**Your task is to modify the function `convert_reservation_data` so that it returns a list where the columns have the following data types:**

```text
reservationId | name | email | phone | reservationDate | reservationTime | durationHours | price | confirmed | reservedResource | createdAt

int | str | str | str | date | time | int | float | bool | str | datetime
```

> [!TIP]  
> Use Python’s `datetime` library:

```python
from datetime import datetime, date, time
```

> [!TIP]  
> Examples of conversions (adapt to your code):

```python
# 1) reservationId: str -> int
reservation_id = int(row[0])

# 5) reservationDate: "2025-11-12" -> datetime.date
reservation_date = datetime.strptime(row[4], "%Y-%m-%d").date()

# 6) reservationTime: "09:00" -> datetime.time
reservation_time = datetime.strptime(row[5], "%H:%M").time()

# 8) price: "18.50" -> float
price = float(row[7])

# 9) confirmed: "True"/"False" -> bool
confirmed = (row[8] == "True")

# 11) createdAt: "2025-08-12 14:33:20" -> datetime.datetime
created_at = datetime.strptime(row[10], "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
```

Finally, the function should return a list where all fields are in the correct order and data types.

> [!TIP]  
> Example (you don’t have to use these exact variable names or this approach, but the idea is the same):

```python
return [
    reservation_id, name, email, phone,
    reservation_date, reservation_time,
    duration_hours, price,
    confirmed, reserved_resource,
    created_at
]
```

***

### 3️⃣ Testing

Make sure the program runs with the command without erros. The program prints each reservation’s details on their own lines. The line is divided into columns, and the data type of each value is shown below the columns.

```bash
python task_c.py
```

***

### 🧩 Tips

*   Make conversions **in small steps** → For example:
    *   first `int` and `float`
    *   then `bool`
    *   finally `datetime.date`, `datetime.time`, and `datetime`
*   If `datetime.strptime` throws an error, check carefully:
    *   what the string looks like in the file
    *   that the format string (`"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`) matches exactly
*   You can add temporary `print` statements for debugging (e.g., `print(row[4], type(reservation_date))`).

***

## 🧠 PART B: Processing Reservations with Loops and Conditionals

In this part, build a program that prints **five different summaries** of reservations in one run. All outputs should appear **in the same program execution (i.e., when running `python task_c.py`, everything prints in order 1–5)**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Use the functions in task_c.py to process and print the values. Modify the existing functions (`confirmed_reservations`, `long_reservations`, `confirmation_statuses`, `confirmation_summary`, `total_revenue`) that were specified and supplied.

***

### 🧩 Tips

*   Progress in small steps, testing after each change.

***

### 1️⃣ Output: All Confirmed Reservations

Header:

```
1) Confirmed Reservations
```

Each reservation should print in this format:

```
- Name, Reserved Resource, dd.mm.yyyy at hh.mm
```

Example:

```
1) Confirmed Reservations
- Moomin Valley, Forest Area 1, 12.11.2025 at 09.00
- Little My Storm, Red Room, 22.10.2025 at 15.45
```

***

### 2️⃣ Output: Long Reservations (duration ≥ 3 h)

Header:

```
2) Long Reservations (≥ 3 h)
```

Format:

```
- Name, dd.mm.yyyy at hh.mm, duration X h, Reserved Resource
```

***

### 3️⃣ Output: Reservation Confirmation Status

Header:

```
3) Reservation Confirmation Status
```

Format:

```
Name → Confirmed
Name → NOT Confirmed
```

***

### 4️⃣ Output: Summary of Confirmed vs Not Confirmed

Header:

```
4) Confirmation Summary
```

Format:

```
- Confirmed reservations: X pcs
- Not confirmed reservations: Y pcs
```

***

### 5️⃣ Output: Total Revenue from Confirmed Reservations (with comma!)

Header:

```
5) Total Revenue from Confirmed Reservations
```

Format:

```
Total revenue from confirmed reservations: 243,50 €
```

Note the comma in the amount:

```python
amount_str = f"{amount:.2f}".replace(".", ",")
```

***

### Example output structure

> This is just an example, not the actual content of the file.

```
1) Confirmed Reservations
- Moomin Valley, Forest Area 1, 12.11.2025 at 09.00
- Hemulen Plant Collector, Botanical Lab, 05.11.2025 at 10.30

2) Long Reservations (≥ 3 h)
- Little My Storm, 22.10.2025 at 15.45, duration 3 h, Red Room
- Sniff Moneywise, 18.09.2025 at 13.00, duration 4 h, Storage Area N

3) Reservation Confirmation Status
Moomin Valley → Confirmed
Snork Maiden → NOT Confirmed
Little My Storm → Confirmed

4) Confirmation Summary
- Confirmed reservations: 1 pcs
- Not confirmed reservations: 2 pcs

5) Total Revenue from Confirmed Reservations
Total revenue from confirmed reservations: 123,50 €
```
