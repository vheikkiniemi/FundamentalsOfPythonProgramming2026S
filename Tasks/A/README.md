# 🐍 Processing a Reservation Line from a File

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this task is to practice:

*   handling and splitting strings (`str`)
*   using various data types (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `datetime`)
*   converting between data types
*   printing information in a structured way

---

## 📄 Description

You are given a text file **`resevations.txt`** that contains one line per reservation.  
You are also given a Python script **`read_resevations.py`** that reads the reservations from **`resevations.txt`**.  
Fields are separated by the pipe character `|`.

> [!TIP]
> This way of structuring data is very common—and Python is great at handling it!

**Example line:**

```
123|Anna Virtanen|2025-10-31|10:00|2|19.95|True|Meeting Room A|0401234567|anna.virtanen@example.com
```

The line contains the following fields:

| Column | Description        | Data Type       |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------- |
| 1      | Reservation number | `int`           |
| 2      | Booker’s name      | `str`           |
| 3      | Reservation date   | `datetime.date` |
| 4      | Start time         | `datetime.time` |
| 5      | Number of hours    | `int`           |
| 6      | Hourly price (€)   | `float`         |
| 7      | Paid               | `bool`          |
| 8      | Resource           | `str`           |
| 9      | Phone number       | `str`           |
| 10     | Email              | `str`           |

## 🧠 Task Instructions

1.  Copy the file **`resevations.txt`** into your own **Git repo** under the folder **`TaskA`**.
2.  Copy the Python script **`read_resevations.py`** into your **Git repo** under the folder **`TaskA`**.
3.  Modify the script so that, when executed, it prints the following output:

```
Reservation number: 123
Booker: Anna Virtanen
Date: 31.10.2025
Start time: 10.00
Number of hours: 2
Hourly price: 19,95 €
Total price: 39,90 €
Paid: Yes
Location: Meeting Room A
Phone: 0401234567
Email: anna.virtanen@example.com
```

### 🧩 Tips

*   Split the line using the `split('|')` method as in the example below → produces a list-type variable (the following examples then work):

    ```python
    resevation = resevation.split('|')
    ```

    > [!NOTE]  
    > If you don’t do the above, in the examples below `resevation[0]` is equivalent to `resevation.split('|')[0]`.

*   Convert data types. A few examples:

    ```python
    resevation_number = int(resevation[0])
    hourly_price = float(resevation[5])
    paid = bool(resevation[6])
    ```

*   You can convert the date and start time to `datetime`:

    ```python
    from datetime import datetime

    day = datetime.strptime(resevation[2], "%Y-%m-%d").date()
    finnish_day = day.strftime("%d.%m.%Y")

    time = datetime.strptime(resevation[3], "%H:%M").time()
    finnish_time = time.strftime("%H.%M")
    ```

> [!TIP]  
> Why is this important, even though we could use plain text?  
> BECAUSE `datetime` doesn’t accept a date like 2025-10-32 and will raise an error during conversion!  
> This helps keep the data consistent and correct!

*   Compute the total price by multiplying the number of hours by the hourly price.

*   If you want to print “Yes” or “No” based on the paid flag, use a conditional expression like this:

    ```python
    print(f"Paid: {'Yes' if paid else 'No'}")
    ```
